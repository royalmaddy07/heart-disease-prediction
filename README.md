# Predicting Heart Disease Severity Using Supervised ML

## Problem Statement
Classifying Heart Disease severity from 0-4 using UCI's labeled dataset

## Brief Overview
This project aims to build a multi-class heart disease prediction system using machine learning techniques on the widely used UCI Heart Disease Dataset. Unlike many studies that treat this as a binary classification (disease/no disease), this project predicts five levels of heart disease severity (0 to 4), making the problem significantly more challenging and clinically meaningful.

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository taken from Kaggle
- Total features: 13 (8 categorical features and 5 numeric features)
- Target Variable: Heart disease severity (0–4)

## ⚙️ Methods Used
- EDA and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Model Training and Hyperparameter tuning
- Models used: Supervised ML Models for Multiclass classification
  - (DT, KNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes)
- Performance Metrics: train-test Accuracy, Precision, Recall(Major), F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

## Results
- details about the best performing model is given in the report.

## 🧰 Technologies used
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, joblib
